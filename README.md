# Design - UI Accessibility

## Inclusive Design vs. Universal Design

UX is required to consider the broad spectrum of needs when designing websites and apps for all audiences. But what is the difference between Universal Design and Inclusive Design?

In most cases, good UX design can mean the difference between a usable app and a waste of time and resources for developers.‌

‌In order for their designs to result in a pleasant user experience, UX designers need to be understanding of their target audience's specific wants and need as a demographic, not as individuals.

### What is universal design?

Universal design is a type of design that makes a product or tool easy to use and accessible to the largest number of users possible regardless of their ability, disability, age, and gender.

Accessible design focuses on ensuring no user faces any unnecessary barrier when using the product. It accommodates people of varying cognitive, physical, and technical abilities.

Proper implementation of accessibility to achieve universal design depends on continuously evaluating the current design of products, as well as testing the products and listening to user feedback from different demographics.

### What is inclusive design?

If universal design is for everyone, then inclusive design focuses on reaching more people who suffer from exclusion by the status quo. Inclusive design looks at the diverse experiences people go through that might otherwise prevent them from comfortably using the product.‌

‌Inclusive design is closer to being a methodology or ideology in design rather than a checklist of features to implement.

Inclusive design goes beyond accessibility by providing comfort—making users feel welcome regardless of their background. For instance, consider an app that flips its entire layout horizontally when dealing with text alternatives and changing to a language that uses right-to-left scripts - such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian. Such a feature considers the cultural and linguistic needs of people beyond accessibility.‌

### Which Is Better for UX?

Universal design takes a one size fits all approach. When utilizing universal design, UX designers may find themselves looking for the ‘average user’ of the product and end up meeting the needs and wants of an imaginary person. While more time and resource-consuming, inclusive design forces designers to innovate and communicate with their target audience and see what they want and need in a product.

‌Universal design can be a stepping stone for many early-stage projects, but it’s limited in its reach. Finding ways to serve all potential users regardless of their demographic or background can result in an improved user experience and inclusive design accommodates both the average user and people with unique circumstances.

‌‌Inclusive design is more time, energy, and resource-intensive, but it makes up for its shortcomings by resulting in products with the greatest numbers of potential users. Inclusively designed products are also open to adaptation and only require occasional small tweaks instead of complete redesigns.
